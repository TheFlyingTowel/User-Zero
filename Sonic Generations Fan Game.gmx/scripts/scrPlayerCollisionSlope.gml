*/

    /* This is a kind of special sensor, wich is used for collision detection
       with exclusively slopes, and it is located below the bottom sensor.
       
       Of course, the functionality of this routine is the same as the bottom
       collision function. Up and down collision functions works in a very
       similar way than the left/right ones. The only difference is in how we
       swap the trigonometric functions in order to calculate the position
       projected over the Y axys. For example:
       
       If for calculating the x projected/rotated positions is:
       
        rotated_x = x + cos( angle ) * distance;
        rotated_y = y - sin( angle ) * distance;
        
       The same for y projected/rotated position is:
        rotated_x = x + sin( angle ) * distance;
        rotated_y = y + cos( angle ) * distance;

       This is the main difference. The other stuff is the same.
